# Machine-Learning-in-Action
### Project Description
In this project I will try to implement some machine learning algorithms in python.
### Branch Management
* There are two branches here: master and dev, I will do daily development in the dev branch, and merge the fully implemented algorithms into the branch master.
* If you want to see the contents of different branches, you can use the following command to switch:
```
$ git checkout dev
$ git checkout master
```
### Data Set
* All classification algorithms for this project will be demonstrated in dealing with handwritten digit recognition. We will use the mnist dataset, which you can get [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### Contents
* KNN(k-NearestNeighbor)
  When using knn for handwritten digit recognition, 95.8% accuracy was obtained on the mnist data set. However, the testing process can take half an hour or more.
