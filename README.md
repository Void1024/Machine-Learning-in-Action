# Machine-Learning-in-Action
### Project Description
In this project I will try to implement some machine learning algorithms in python.
### Branch Management
* There are two branches here: master and dev, I will do daily development in the dev branch, and merge the fully implemented algorithms into the branch master.
* If you want to see the contents of different branches, you can use the following command to switch:
```
$ git checkout dev
$ git checkout master
```
