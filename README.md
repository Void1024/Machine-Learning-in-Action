# Machine-Learning-in-Action
>###Project Description
>In this project I will try to implement some machine learning algorithms in python.
>###Branch Management
>* There are two branches here: master and dev, I will do daily development in the dev branch, and merge the fully implemented algorithms into the branch master.
>* If you want to see the contents of different branches, you can use the following command to switch:
